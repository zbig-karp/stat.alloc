\title{Two-dimensional differential mixing model with the minimum-distance estimation routine}
\usage{
dmm2d_mde(dat)
}
\arguments{
\item{dat}{An object returned by the function \code{refall2d}}
}
\value{
a list with four elements:
\itemize{
\item a tibble with the estimated coefficients and relevant statistical tests;
\item a matrix representing the model-predicted status allocation;
\item the index of dissimilarity between the observed and model-predicted status allocations;
\item the minimised distance (i.e., the Frobenius norm of the difference) between the observed and model-predicted status allocations
}
